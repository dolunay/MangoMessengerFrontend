## What is all about

Mango Messenger is an opensource instant messaging system such that implemented using ASP NET 5 framework as REST API
backend along with Angular framework as frontend. In general, current project is considered to be a diploma project in
order to get bachelor's degree of computer science. However, now it is considered to be a just example of ASP .NET Core
API implementation using best practices in terms of architecture etc, where it is possible to apply different software
development approaches and to see how it works on different environments such as Azure, Heroku etc. Moreover, a few
cryptographical concepts are implemented such as DH key exchange that can be applied in order to implement secret chats
in feature. Current frontend implementation has three basic components:

- **Main**: component responsible for files and messages exchange
